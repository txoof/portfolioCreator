    "Create student cumulative folders on Google Drive using Google FileStream using exports from PowerSchool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Start\n",
    "**IMPORTANT if you have never run the application see the [First Run Instructions](#FirstRun) below!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes you already have [Google FileStream](https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/GoogleDriveFileStream.dmg) installed and are signed in as well as a prepared student.export file from PowerSchool.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the application from [this link](https://github.com/txoof/portfolioCreator/raw/master/createFolders.tgz)\n",
    "2. Locate the file `createFolders.tgz` -- likely in your `Downloads` folder\n",
    "3. Double click on the file to decompress it\n",
    "4. Locate the createFolders icon and drag it into your `Applications` folder\n",
    "5. Locate the createFolders icon in your `Applications` folder and double click on it to run\n",
    "    * If you receive error messages or popups preventing you from running the application see the [Help](#Help) section\n",
    "7. Click \"Process File\" to begin processing a student.export file from PowerSchool\n",
    "6. If this is the first time you have run this program, you will be asked to choose a Google Shared drive **and** cumulative student folder. \n",
    "    * If you are unsure how to do this, see the [Help](#Help) section\n",
    "8. When prompted slect a student export file to process by clicking \"Browse\"\n",
    "9. Click \"Ok\" to begin the processing\n",
    "10. When the process is complete, review the summary\n",
    "    * A record of the completed tasks is made on your desktop in a folder called `createFolders`\n",
    "    * Make sure to send the `YYYY-MM-DD_Portfolio_Links_for_PowerSchool.csv` to the PowerSchool Administrator\n",
    "11. You may process another file immediately if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "createFolders depends on a working instance of [Google FileStream](https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/GoogleDriveFileStream.dmg) installed and signed in with an account that can write to the Student Cumulative Folders shared drive. See the [Help](#Help) section for assistance in setting up FileStream.\n",

    "<a name=\"prepareExport\"> </a>\n",
    "### Prepare a student.export.text file\n",
    "\n",
    "createFolders reads data from PowerSchool exports to create folders in Google Drive and prepare links for the demographics page. This section details the preparation of a student.export.text file that can be used with createFolders.\n",
    "\n",
    "createFolders will **not create duplicate folders** for existing students and will not create folders when a duplicate student number is found. This means that you can run the same batch of students several times without harm. If a folder already exists, it will simply be checked for consistency and further ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Locate Students for Export\n",
    "Locate any new students in PowerSchool and run a quick export. This query can be very helpful: `Grade_Level=X;DistrictEntryDate>=MM/DD/YYYY`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quick Export Fields\n",
    "When running a Quick Export the following fileds **must be included**. Any additional fields will be ignored. \n",
    "```\n",
    "LastFirst\n",
    "Student_Number\n",
    "ClassOf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Opperation\n",
    "createFolders has only four options when run in graphical mode:\n",
    "* Process File\n",
    "* Change Shared Drive\n",
    "* Help\n",
    "* Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"ProcessFile\"></a>\n",
    "#### Process File\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a student.export file and create student folders as needed. The student.export file must be in a delimited format such as a tsv or csv with the folowing column headers: `LastFirst, Student_Number, ClassOf`. These fields can be in any order. Additional fields will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data rows must follow the following data types:\n",
    "* `LastFirst` -- string \n",
    "* `Student_Number` -- integer\n",
    "* `ClassOf` -- integer\n",
    "\n",
    "Data rows that do not conform will be ignored and recorded in `~/Desktop/createFolders` as a csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the opporation is completed, a summary of the completed procedures will open. **READ** all of the summary. There may be some students that could not be processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Share the Links TXT file with the PS Administrator so PowerSchool links can be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A report of any Errors and files that must be sent to the PS Administator is stored in a folder on your Desktop called *createFolders*. **READ** the entire window. Be sure to review the any ERROR files and correct the errors! **YOU MUST** run the application again to create forlders for the students with errors. It is possible to simply process the Error file by selecting it. You may also run the same student export again; duplicate folders will ***not*** be created.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Change Shared Drive\n",
    "Choose the shared drive **and folder** where cumulative folders are stored.

    "\n",
    "Choosing an improper Google Shared drive will result in the following errors:\n",
    "* Local or Non-Google Drive: `\"/Users/spamham/Documents\" is not a Google Drive. Choose a Google Shared Drive.`\n",
    "* Google Drive, but typo in folder name: `\"/Volumes/GoogleDrive/Shared drives/ASH Student Cumulative Folders/Student Cumulative Folders (AKA Student Portfolios)TYPO!\" does not appear to exist on Google Drive. Choose a different Drive and folder.`\n",
    "* Google Shared Drive that does not contain **`sentryFile_DO_NOT_REMOVE.txt`**: `This does not appear to be the correct folder for Cumulative Student Folders...`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that the **`sentryFile_DO_NOT_REMOVE.txt`** is not found, double check the following:\n",
    "1. The appropriate google shared drive is chosen\n",
    "2. The proper **folder** within the drive is chosen and contains **`sentryFile_DO_NOT_REMOVE.txt`**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sentry file is has been deleted or is otherwise missing, a new file can be created by running the following command from the terminal. This command must be run from an account that has FileStream running and with access to the shared drive. **It is critical that you double, tripple and quadruple check that this is actually the correct drive and folder before proceeding.**\n",
