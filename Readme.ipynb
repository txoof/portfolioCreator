    "Create student cumulative folders on Google Drive using Google FileStream using exports from PowerSchool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Start\n",
    "This assumes you already have [Google FileStream](https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/GoogleDriveFileStream.dmg) installed and are signed in as well as a prepared student.export file from PowerSchool.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the application from [this link](https://github.com/txoof/portfolioCreator/raw/master/createFolders.tgz)\n",
    "2. Locate the file `createFolders.tgz` -- likely in your `Downloads` folder\n",
    "3. Double click on the file to decompress it\n",
    "4. Locate the createFolders icon and drag it into your `Applications` folder\n",
    "5. Locate the createFolders icon in your `Applications` folder and double click on it to run\n",
    "    * If you receive error messages or popups preventing you from running the application see the [Help](#Help) section\n",
    "7. Click \"Process File\" to begin processing a student.export file from PowerSchool\n",
    "6. If this is the first time you have run this program, you will be asked to choose a Google Shared drive **and** cumulative student folder. \n",
    "    * If you are unsure how to do this, see the [Help](#Help) section\n",
    "8. When prompted slect a student export file to process by clicking \"Browse\"\n",
    "9. Click \"Ok\" to begin the processing\n",
    "10. When the process is complete, review the summary\n",
    "    * A record of the completed tasks is made on your desktop in a folder called `createFolders`\n",
    "    * Make sure to send the `YYYY-MM-DD_Portfolio_Links_for_PowerSchool.csv` to the PowerSchool Administrator\n",
    "11. You may process another file immediately if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "createFolders depends on a working instance of [Google FileStream](https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/GoogleDriveFileStream.dmg) installed and signed in with an account that can write to the Student Cumulative Folders shared drive. See the [Help](#Help) section for assistance in setting up FileStream.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare a student.export.text file\n",
    "createFolders reads data from PowerSchool exports to create folders in Google Drive and prepare links for the demographics page. This section details the preparation of a student.export.text file that can be used with createFolders.\n",
    "\n",
    "createFolders will **not create duplicate folders** for existing students and will not create folders when a duplicate student number is found. This means that you can run the same batch of students several times without harm. If a folder already exists, it will simply be checked for consistency and further ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Locate Students for Export\n",
    "Locate any new students in PowerSchool and run a quick export. This query can be very helpful: `Grade_Level=X;DistrictEntryDate>=MM/DD/YYYY`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quick Export Fields\n",
    "When running a Quick Export the following fileds **must be included**. Any additional fields will be ignored. \n",
    "```\n",
    "LastFirst\n",
    "Student_Number\n",
    "ClassOf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Opperation\n",
    "createFolders has only four options when run in graphical mode:\n",
    "* Process File\n",
    "* Change Shared Drive\n",
    "* Help\n",
    "* Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process File\n",
    "Select a student.export file and create student folders as needed. The student.export file must be in a delimited format such as a tsv or csv with the folowing column headers: `LastFirst, Student_Number, ClassOf`. These fields can be in any order. Additional fields will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data rows must follow the following data types:\n",
    "* `LastFirst` -- string \n",
    "* `Student_Number` -- integer\n",
    "* `ClassOf` -- integer\n",
    "\n",
    "Data rows that do not conform will be ignored and recorded in `~/Desktop/createFolders` as a csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Change Shared Drive\n",
    "Choose the shared drive **and folder** where cumulative folders are stored. This is the location where all cumulative folders are stored. createFolders preforms several checks to ensure you have chosen the appropriate drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "createFolders looks for a specific file called `sentryFile_DO_NOT_REMOVE.txt` in the `Student Cumulative Folders (AKA Student Portfolios)` folder. If this file is missing, createFolders will not proceed. See below for more information in remedying this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing an improper Google Shared drive will result in the following errors:\n",
    "* Local or Non-Google Drive: `\"/Users/spamham/Documents\" is not a Google Drive. Choose a Google Shared Drive.`\n",
    "* Google Drive, but typo in folder name: `\"/Volumes/GoogleDrive/Shared drives/ASH Student Cumulative Folders/Student Cumulative Folders (AKA Student Portfolios)TYPO!\" does not appear to exist on Google Drive. Choose a different Drive and folder.`\n",
    "* Google Shared Drive that does not contain **`sentryFile_DO_NOT_REMOVE.txt`**: `This does not appear to be the correct folder for Cumulative Student Folders...`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that the **`sentryFile_DO_NOT_REMOVE.txt`** is not found, double check the following:\n",
    "1. The appropriate google shared drive is chosen\n",
    "2. The proper **folder** within the drive is chosen and contains **`sentryFile_DO_NOT_REMOVE.txt`**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sentry file is has been deleted or is otherwise missing, a new file can be created by running the following command from the terminal. This command must be run from an account that has FileStream running and with access to the shared drive. **It is critical that you double, tripple and quadruple check that this is actually the correct drive and folder before proceeding.**\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ touch /Volumes/GoogleDrive/Shared drives/DRIVE NAME/FOLDER NAME/sentryFile_DO_NOT_REMOVE.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Help\n",
    "The help button provides a brief version of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exit\n",
    "Exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command Line Mode\n",
    "More debugging features are available on the command line. createFolders will accept student.export files with the `-s [file]` option.\n",

    "![unidentified developer window](./documentation/unidentified_devel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This error indicates that the program was not created by an \"official\" developer. In this case, this is not a problem. Take the following steps to run the program:\n",
    "1. Locate the program file (likely in your `Applications` folder)\n",
    "2. Right-click or ctrl-click on the file and choose \"Open\"\n",
    "3. A pop-up window will likely appear -- *if no pop-up appears, no further action is needed*\n",

    "### Choosing the Shared Drive and Cumulative Student Folder\n",
    "![choose the Google Shared Drive and Cumulative folder](./documentation/choose_gdrive.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "createFolders needs to know both which Google Shared Drive to use and the folder where Student Cumulative Folders are stored. The first time you run createFolders, it will ask you to choose the appropriate drive and folder.\n",

    "    * If FileStream is active and working properly, you will be automatically directed to the Google Drives available to you.\n",
    "3. Double click the \"Shared drives\" folder and locate the appropriate folder\n",
    "    * This is likely called `ASH Student Cumulative Folders` or something similar\n",
    "4. Locate the folder within the shared drive that contains cumulative folders and click on it\n",
    "    * This is likely called `Student Cumulative Folders (AKA Student Portfolios)`\n",
    "5. Click \"Choose\" to select the folder to return back to createFolders\n",
    "6. Click \"OK\" to accept the shared drive\n",
    "    * createFolders works very hard to ensure you have selected the appropriate drive and will try to prevent you from using an improper folder.\n",
    "    * You can always change this folder later if you have made a mistake\n",
    "7. Click \"Process File\" to begin processing a student.export file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Google FileStream\n",
    "Google FileStream is required for createFolders. The user must be signed in with an account that has write permissions to the Student Cumulative folders drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download [Google FileStream](https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/GoogleDriveFileStream.dmg) and run the installer.\n",
    "2. Launch Google FileStream if it is not running (look for the icon in the menu bar) and click \"Sign in\"\n",
    "    ![filestream icon](./documentation/filestream_ico.png)\n",
    "3. Use your @ash.nl credentials for an account that has access to the cumulative folders drive.\n",
    "    * You will likely be asked to sign in using your two-step verification; this is normal\n",
    "4. Click on the filestream icon in the menu bar and click on the folder icon to view your google drive files\n",
    "    * It may take several minutes before your folders and files are all visible\n",
    "5. Browse to the `Shared drives` and locate the `ASH Student Cumulative Folders` drive to confirm you have access\n",
    "    * If you do not have access, you have likely used an account that does not have permissions. Sign out and try again."
